# Introduction
Peer Organized 'Omics Help (POOH)
A bioinformatics working group at UC Davis

The purpose of this group is to provide a space for grad students and other academic researchers to get together and help each other with code and various types of computer work. As the name implies, we are mostly focused on the analysis of various types of 'omics data, but can be convinced to consider other datasets! This can also be a great opportunity to get additional help with our course material or ideas of how to implement our course material in your own research.
